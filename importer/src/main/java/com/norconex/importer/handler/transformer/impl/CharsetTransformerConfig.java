/**
 * <p>
 * Transforms a document content (if needed) from a source character
 * encoding (charset) to a target one. Both the source and target character
 * encodings are optional. If no source character encoding is explicitly
 * provided, it first tries to detect the encoding of the document
 * content before converting it to the target encoding. If the source
 * character encoding cannot be established, the content encoding will remain
 * unchanged. When no target character encoding is specified, UTF-8 is assumed.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>Should I use this transformer?</h3>
 * <p>
 * Before using this transformer, you need to know the parsing of documents
 * by the importer using default document parser factory will try to convert
 * and return content as UTF-8 (for most, if not all content-types).
 * If UTF-8 is your desired target, it only make sense to use this transformer
 * as a pre-parsing handler (for text content-types only) when it is important
 * to work with a specific character encoding before parsing.
 * If on the other hand you wish to convert to a character encoding to a
 * target different than UTF-8, you can use this transformer as a post-parsing
 * handler to do so.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>Conversion is not flawless</h3>
 * <p>
 * Because character encoding detection is not always accurate and because
 * documents sometime mix different encoding, there is no guarantee this
 * class will handle ALL character encoding conversions properly.
 * </p>
 *
 * {@nx.xml.usage
 * <handler class="com.norconex.importer.handler.transformer.impl.CharsetTransformer"
 *     sourceCharset="(character encoding)"

 * <handler class="CharsetTransformer"

 * The above example converts the content of a document from "ISO-8859-1"
 * to "UTF-8".
