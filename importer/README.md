==========

Norconex Importer is a Java library and command-line application meant to 
"parse" and "extract" content out of a computer file as plain text, whatever 
its format (HTML, PDF, Word, etc). In addition, it allows you to perform any 
manipulation on the extracted text before importing/using it in your own 
service or application.
