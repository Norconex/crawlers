# Welcome to Norconex Crawler

Norconex Crawler is an open-source, enterprise-grade crawling framework that collects content
from **websites** and **file systems** and delivers it to search engines, databases, and data
pipelines — without vendor lock-in.

## Two crawlers, one framework

|                      | Web Crawler                                      | File system Crawler                                   |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Sources**          | HTTP/S websites and web applications             | Local and remote file storage across many protocols   |
| **How it navigates** | Follows hyperlinks; can render JavaScript        | Traverses directory trees; resolves paths by protocol |
| **Typical use case** | Web indexing, site monitoring, content archiving | Document management, network storage indexing         |

Both crawlers share the same configuration model, pipeline, and committer system.
Learn one, know both.

## Core concepts at a glance

- **Crawl session** — a named, resumable run with persistent state
- **Pipeline** — every document flows through: Crawl → Filter → Transform → Commit
- **Committers** — pluggable output targets (Elasticsearch, Solr, Kafka, SQL, Neo4j, ...)

A hosted companion tool, the [Visual Configurator](https://crawlerconfig.norconex.com),
lets you build and validate crawler configs visually — it is not part of the open-source
distribution.
