/**
 * <p>
 * Introduces different delays between document downloads based on matching
 * document reference (URL) patterns.
 * There are a few ways the actual delay value can be defined (in order):
 * </p>
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Takes the delay specify by a robots.txt file.
 *       Only applicable if robots.txt files and its robots crawl delays
 *       are not ignored.</li>
 *   <li>Takes the delay matching a reference pattern, if any (picks the first
 *       one matching).</li>
 *   <li>Used the specified default delay or 3 seconds, if none is
 *       specified.</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * One of these following scope dictates how the delay is applied, listed
 * in order from the best behaved to the least.
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>crawler</b>: the delay is applied between each URL download
 *       within a crawler instance, regardless how many threads are defined
 *       within that crawler, or whether URLs are from the
 *       same site or not.  This is the default scope.</li>
 *   <li><b>site</b>: the delay is applied between each URL download
 *       from the same site within a crawler instance, regardless how many
 *       threads are defined. A site is defined by a URL protocol and its
 *       domain (e.g. http://example.com).</li>
 *   <li><b>thread</b>: the delay is applied between each URL download from
 *       any given thread.  The more threads you have the less of an
 *       impact the delay will have.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * As of 2.7.0, XML configuration entries expecting millisecond durations
 * can be provided in human-readable format (English only), as per
 * {@link DurationParser} (e.g., "5 minutes and 30 seconds" or "5m30s").
 * </p>
 *
 * {@nx.xml.usage
 * <delay class="com.norconex.crawler.web.delay.impl.ReferenceDelayResolver"
 *         default="(milliseconds)"
 *         ignoreRobotsCrawlDelay="[false|true]"
 *         scope="[crawler|site|thread]">
 *     <pattern delay="(delay in milliseconds)">
 *       (regular expression applied against document reference)
 *     </pattern>
 *
 *     (... repeat pattern tag as needed ...)
 * </delay>
 * }
 *
 * {@nx.xml.example
 * <pre>
 * <delay class="ReferenceDelayResolver" default="3 seconds" >
 *     <pattern delay="10 seconds">.*\.pdf</pattern>
 * </delay>
 * }
 * <p>
 * The above examlpe will increase the delay to 10 seconds when encountering
 * PDFs from a default of 3 seconds.
