To run the test, go to the root directory where you uncompressed the 
distribution zip and run the following in a command-line console.

Windows:
========

Minimal test:

collector-http.bat start -config=examples\minimum\minimum-config.xml


Complex test:

collector-http.bat start -config=examples\complex\complex-config.xml


Unix/Linux:
===========

Minimal test:

collector-http.sh start -config=examples/minimum/minimum-config.xml


Complex test:

collector-http.sh start -config=examples/complex/complex-config.xml


-----------

Look for a directory called "examples-output".  You will
find sub-directories matching the test you ran.  In them, you will find
a directory called "crawledFiles" containing the collected data.

You need Internet access to run the examples.  Modify the example files
if you wish to run them on a private network.
