/**
 * <p>
 * Commits documents to XML files.  There are two kinds of document
 * representations: upserts and deletions.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If you request to split upserts and deletions into separate files,
 * the generated files will start with "upsert-" (for additions/modifications)
 * and "delete-" (for deletions).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The generated files are never updated.  Sending a modified document with the
 * same reference will create a new entry and won't modify any existing ones.
 * You can think of the generated files as a set of commit instructions.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The generated XML file names are made of a timestamp and a sequence number.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You have the option to give a prefix or suffix to
 * files that will be created (default does not add any).
 * </p>
