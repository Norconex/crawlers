format for you to test.

To run the test, go to the root directory where you uncompressed the 
distribution zip and run the following.

Windows:

importer.bat -i "examples/books/alice-in-wonderland-chapter1.pdf" -c "examples/config/sample-config.xml"

Unix/Linux:

importer.sh -i "examples/books/alice-in-wonderland-chapter1.pdf" -c "examples/config/sample-config.xml"

Change the extension to ".docx" or ".zip" for a different test.

Look into the example/books folder for new files being created containing
the exported data.
